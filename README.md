# disnap R package

disnap --- a package for analysis of disease snapshot data.

## Principal purpose
This package is used to analyse disease snapshot data, i.e. data on infection status of individual units (locations/entities) taken at discrete points in time. For example, annual data on disease occurrence from farms located in a particular region.

Main functionality is to provide functions to compute several statistical properties of a data set and associated data (e.g. properties of units, links between units)

This package treats the temporal component as a discrete value and is not suitable to perform continuous analysis of the temporal dimension.

## Further development

The following features will be added in next versions:

* Analysis of network data
* Preformance improvement for large datasets
